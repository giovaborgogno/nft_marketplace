# NFT Marketplace: https://nft-market.giovaborgogno.com

<p>Welcome to the NFT Marketplace where you can upload your images and watch them turn into NFTs. Here, you can trade your NFTs with other creators.</p>
<p>We have used <i>Next.js - A fullstack react framework,</i> to build the project deployed it on our own VPS. For the smart contract deployment, We've used hardhat and used ETH to power the smart contract!</p>

## Steps to install locally:

### 1. Environment. 

Create a .env file using .env.example.

You need to get: 

a NFT Storage Token in: https://nft.storage/docs/#get-an-api-token

a Infura Public Key in: https://docs.infura.io/getting-started#2-create-an-api-key

### 2. Run.

Run the docker compose.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

<p>Thank You ❤️</p>
